üèÄ Predicting the NBA 2020-21 season playoff seeds üèÄ

I, Rama Goparaju, have been a lifelong sports fan. Along with this,I have always been interested in statistics.
Before starting this blog, I had a background in computer science, but I had absolutely no programming experience with Python. After learning the some basics of Python and the Pandas library (like how to make lists, dataframes, print things, create graphs etc.), I was eager to jump in to my first project. Through doing these projects, I'm hoping to improve my coding skills and gather better understanding of statistics and data science in sports.
This is my first attempt at a sports analysis using Python.

Before kicking off, I want to thank a few people for the amazing inspiration:
1. Kenneth Jee (https://www.kennethjee.com/) for the highly informative videos on his youtube channel, and for suggesting...
2. Wayne Winston's book "Mathletics: How Gamblers, Managers, and Sports Enthusiasts Use Mathematics in Baseball, Basketball, and Football" (ISBN: 978-0691154589)
3. The book is where I picked up the Pythagorean expecatation in sports that is the center piece of this analysis
4. Jacques Coetzee github code which helped me put the team logos on the scatter plot

The data used in this analysis is picked up from Basketball Reference conference standings tables
